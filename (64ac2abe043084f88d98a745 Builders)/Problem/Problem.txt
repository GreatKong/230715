Given an N × M integer grid, and each element is 1, 2,..., N ×  M, (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 500)
You have a rectangle table whose location is integer 1.
Each time, you have to perform one of the following four operations:
1. 'U' : move the upper bound of the table one unit up.
2. 'D' : move the lower bound of the table one unit down.
3. 'L' : move the left bound of the table one unit left.
4. 'R' : move the right bound of the table one unit right.
Each time you do the operation, the new addition numbers are the smallest possible numbers.
Print the operation as one string. (It is guaranteed that there is one valid solution.)
