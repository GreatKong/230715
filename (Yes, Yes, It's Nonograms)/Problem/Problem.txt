Nonograms, also known as paint by Numbers or Hanjie, are logic puzzles that involve filling a grid with black and white squares based on sequences of numbers associated with each row and column. The numbers indicate the length of consecutive black squares in that row or column. By applying a process of elimination and using the constraints provided by filled squares, players can gradually reveal the picture. This problem focuses on solving Nonograms using a simple technique of filling black squares and deducing white squares based on known information.
